# CRAW++

CRAW++ is the _C++ Reddit API Wrapper_. CRAW++ is intended to be used as a library which can be included in a C++ project to access the Reddit API rather than making HTTP calls manually using `libcurl` or some other library. CRAW++ strives to be as easy to learn and use as possible while still being feature-rich. This project exists mainly because previous attempts to create a C++ Reddit API wrapper were unmaintained and undocumented.

This project is unfinished.

## Dependencies
